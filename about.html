    <p>Cursed Casino is a first-person fantasy roguelike set in a dark medieval world where a cursed protagonist must conquer procedurally generated dungeons, forests, and other perilous realms connected through magical portals. Blending strategy and chance, players gamble for power-ups or debuffs, wield melee, ranged, or magical weapons, and choose buffs upon leveling up to shape their playstyle. Each area features unique enemies and optional elite foes offering high rewards, while diverse bosses with distinct strengths and weaknesses demand tactical mastery. Through risk, combat, and exploration, the player must defeat powerful bosses to break the curse and escape the deadly game of fate.
