    <h2>The Dungeon Witch (First Realm – Depths, bone, decay, and traps):</h2>

    <p>Ostella seeks to unlock forbidden knowledge, the knowledge to cheat death. She believes to gain this knowledge she must collect as many souls as possible. She has mastery over the dead.

    <h3>Motivation:</h3>
    <p>Eldra believes humanity has corrupted nature with their impurities. She has shaped her dimension into a giant fortress of living plants, all monsters in her realm have plants growing on them. Aldric originally could sense nearby enemies, traps, and hidden pathways a “sixth sense”. Eldra took this ability to make it easier to ambush and to grow her control while in the forest realm.</p>

    <h2>Queen Witch Seraph (Final Realm – Central Antagonist): </h2>
    <h3>Motivation:</h3>
    <p>She seeks to merge all realms into one under her rule. Her own dark and twisted realm. She steals Aldric’s power of realm travel to prevent anyone from travelling between dimensions without her being the one letting them. In her view a world under her reign is a balanced world. (after defeating her the player will be able to navigate back through the realms taking paths they did not take before without the need of dying to return).</p>
    <h3>Attitude:</h3>
    <p>She is cold and rational, she is manipulative everyone even her fellow witches are just a tool to her. Rarely acts out of emotions every action and every word has been calculated and plotted. An intimidating aura follows her.</p>
